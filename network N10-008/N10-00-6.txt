the CSMA CD is used in a ethernet network and its not in used anymore
but the CSMA CA is used in a wirless network 
was used in the Apple tak 


colliuson domain 
a collison can happene in aa segmenent 

wach network segemnt can have a collsuion domainm 
a segenmnt can be conacted by
switch 
hub 
router 


the full duplrsd will neverhave a colluison 
Tx and Rx tx stands for transmit4er and Rx stand for reciver 

the collison happenes in a half duples network 


the MTU maximum transmission Unit 
its the amout of data that can be sent on the line whiotu teh need to fragment it 
dsefult 
ethernet is 1500 bytes 
dialup ppp is 296 btes  is the router ocnnectedx to another router wihtout any networking directluy 

Most synchronous serial WAN protocols are 1500 bytes

Hub 
ther is 
passive huh si a spliter it doesnt geretaed teh singal  
active hub it geretaes the signal 
the hub is half duples only 

switchg 
connect the device on lan to the network and tyo the router

its hardwrae devie that makes forwARDING decision based onm the mac Adrress 
tjhe siwtch learns all the mac address and learns and builds A table looded 
how how does the MAC flooding attacks owrks the sietch will be flooded 
and the table qill be full 
uses a ASIC application-specific intergated circuit 
a 48 ports siwtch couls have a 24 coverstaon happeneing at trhe smae time 



whats a router connects a entire network thicx could be LAN  or WAN
forwards the packet on a layer 3 which is the ip address 
 the decsionb are softera based 
 preformn a route look up 
 now the router read its routble table bepfore senduing the opacket if there is no entry the rouiter 
 will send the packet to its deafult or will drop it 
 it doiesnt examine the sourcw ip address 



whats a SOHO 
small office home ooffice 
oits the rou ter thta is beening used in the hoeme and offices for ju7st a few users 


Multi layer sieytch isd a layer 3 siwtch 
the normal switch will forward traffic basedon the MAC address but the layer 3 sioetch is better becayse #
forward the traffic and the packets basse on the ip addres and tghen mac address 
itsmuch better than the sietvch the layer 3 sietches owrtks at layer 2 and up 

has a 24 or 48 ports 
hass a fiber optic cable 
or rj  45 

media converter i sused whenthe router doesnt acommdated with the routing 
this could be from fiber to twisted pair 
or it could be from caox to fiber and so on 

port forwardign 
is trhe procces of accesing content from one pc to another or it could be the server 
the request will have to go through the deafult gate way then tyhe rouiter has tro froward the requets 
port forwardign is access private network from a acomputer 



IPS 
IDS 
they both inspect packets and check the singuter to detct if nay attack will occur sin anetwork 
now IDS cant prevent zero day attack 
buyt IPS can prevent anbs sends an alert to tyhe router to block that traffic 

collion domain isa when two copnpuerts try to sned packet at the sAME TIME now a cxollison domain could be 
in the sme segment or the same net3ork 
the whole segemtn could be a collion domain 

brodcast dopmain isa hwner a computers sneding and recivng brodcast from one another 
now if we have one large brocast doaimn thic ould be a problem and the bandwith will be less 
to sprereate this will use a router because the router cant foroward brocast
