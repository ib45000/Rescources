there is two types of routing 
static teh admin will manually enter the whole network and have to manually 
uodater thge routing table  
dynamiuc the rouitin is automatec 

rules of routing:
the router  must know ehat to do with the packet
the router must have an entry for tyhe detnation and it must have a deafult route 
if not of tghese exist the router wil drop the packet and send an ICMP message 
if router recive a packet it must kniow how to send it back 

------------------------------------------------
packet delivery on the same network 
using the layer 2 which is the MAC address 

router A router B 

A wants to sedn to B 
A  detremine if it know the ip address of B fi it doesnt 
A oreform a DNS lookup yo get B ip address 
A get teh address ,A uses its subnet mask to check if B on the same netowrk 
A doesnt know the MAC addres of B 
A sends an ARP request to get the MAC address B replaies with its mac address 
A get the MAC addresss then form a packet with the source and destnation ip address and the mac addressin an ethernet headerr 
B notics that the packet is for it then it picks it up  and send
it to B and if B wwantsd yo replay the same process will be reopatedx 
all of these will pass by the NIC 

---------------------------------------------------
ip routign across a siongel router 

the router will check to see if it already know the deafult gate wa of teh router #
if it doesnt know it the packet undliverable .
if it knows the router check if it has the mac address in the cache 
if it doesnt the router sends an ARP brodcast and the router will rreplay 
then it puts it in an ethernet header and transmit the frame 
the routrert will recive the frame then it checks to see if it has a routable in the table 
if it doesnt the packet wil be marked undliverable and ICMP message wil besnt 
if it does it sends an ARP to leasntr the next mac address tne replace the soruce and the destantion mac addresss 
the source ad ip address will remain the same 



NOTE ;
layer 2 using the MAC address will transmit Frames 
layer 3 using the Ip adress will transmit packets 


---------------------------------------------------
Routing protocl types:

distnace vector 
uses RIP 
link state 
uses OSPF
Hybrid 
uses EGIRP
Paths vecotr 
uses BGP


we have an interior vs extriort routing 
interior is whitihin a orivate network 
normally uses RIP,OSPF,EGIRP 
extrior 
uses BGP this is normally between the ISP route to the internnnet 

---------------------------------------------------


routign acrosss mutiple rpouter 

the router will take the pakcet check the destnationip address then forward it
while taking one count of the TTL metric hope counts 
each router cvhanges the MAC address of the layer 2 this is becasue to get the packert to th next destantion
till the packet is dleivered
