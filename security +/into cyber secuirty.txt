achieve may hide data 

we have ROT 13
and XOR cybpighjer 


we also haver DES and 3DES triple all encryption 
DES uses a 56 bit key 
3DES uses a three rounds encryption cipher text

wekaness WEP uses a 64 bit or 128 boit jkey number 


no wdsays we use the iee802.11i 
which uses teh  WPA and the WPA2 

we have got two modes of WPA 
we have:
WPA peronal 
WPA enterprise 

IEE802.11X 
these iws an athunticaating prtoocl

Module 11 
all the diffrent ypes of  offline passowrd attacks

Offline password attacks include:
• Brute force
• Mask
• Rule
• Dictionary
• Rainbow tables
• Password collections


 
socxial enginering 
phidhiong shoulder surfing dumbsert deiving

-Keylogger, protocol analyzer
-Man-in-the-middle and replay attacks



Tokens 
also OTP one tyime ppassowwrd 
TOTP time based on time passowrd

---------------------------------------------------------------

Module 12 
all the acces control are :
Five major access control models
• Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
• Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
• Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
• Rule Based Access Control 
• Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

an accoutnt that is still active even after any employee has left '
is called an orphgan account 
Dormant acccount an acoutn that hasnt been accessed for long time 


the ACL ported to SQL as well so it can provide a data basse for secuioirty 


Each entry in the ACL table is called access control entry (ACE)


• Different services can be used to provide identity and access services:
• RADIUS
• Kerberos
• Terminal Access Control Access Control Systems
• Generic servers built on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
(LDAP)
• Security Assertion Markup Language
• Authentication framework protocols


RADIUS 
 was devloped iin 1992 
 
 LDAP light weight active dirctory 
it run overs tcp / ip 



 X.500 is a standred diecrectory for network 


--------------------------------------------------
mdoule 13 


threew typesd of pen test that acan be conducted 
black box 
white box 
geray box 

Active reconnaissance – involves actively probing the system to find 
information
• Passive reconnaissance – the tester uses tools that do not raise any 
alarm
